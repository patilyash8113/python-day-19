# python-day-19
Day 14 of my Python journey
-Today I start an important module in Python called "OOPS."
-OOP stands for object-oriented programming.
-OOPs is basically a way to model what we write in a program in the real world.
In OOP, I learn
1) class: A class is a blueprint or a template, EG.form for an exam that contains name, age, electives, father's name..etc.
2)object: specific instance created from the template (class).

in the following example, I write a code that has a class Employee
that contains a variable called company.
- and I create a method get_salary 
-and create two objects e and e2 
and print both, and the output is 34000.
Why was 34000 printed?
-because we assign a value in the class employee that prints multiple objects in one output.
-What is self here?
-self refers to an object of class which is being created, so in our case, the self is e and e2.
